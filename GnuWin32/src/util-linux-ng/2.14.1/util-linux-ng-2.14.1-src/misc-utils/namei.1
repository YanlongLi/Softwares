.SH NAME
namei - follow a pathname until a terminal point is found
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B namei
.I [-mx]
.I pathname
.I "[ pathname ... ]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Namei
uses its arguments as pathnames to any type
of Unix file (symlinks, files, directories, and so forth). 
.I Namei
then follows each pathname until a terminal 
point is found (a file, directory, char device, etc).
If it finds a symbolic link, we show the link, and start
following it, indenting the output to show the context.
.PP
This program is useful for finding a "too many levels of
symbolic links" problems.
.PP
For each line output,
.I namei
outputs a the following characters to identify the file types found:
.LP
.nf
   f: = the pathname we are currently trying to resolve
    d = directory
    l = symbolic link (both the link and it's contents are output)
    s = socket
    b = block device
    c = character device
    p = FIFO (named pipe)
    - = regular file
    ? = an error of some kind
.fi
.PP
.I Namei
prints an informative message when
the maximum number of symbolic links this system can have has been exceeded.
