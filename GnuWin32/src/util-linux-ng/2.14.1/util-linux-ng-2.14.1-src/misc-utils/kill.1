.TH KILL 1 "14 October 1994" "Linux Utilities" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
kill \- terminate a process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "kill [ \-s " signal " | \-p ] [ \-a ] [ \-\- ] " "pid ..."
.br
.BI "kill -l [ " signal " ]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The command
.B kill
sends the specified signal to the specified process or process group.
If no signal is specified, the TERM signal is sent.  The TERM signal
will kill processes which do not catch this signal.  For other processes,
it may be necessary to use the KILL (9) signal, since this signal cannot
be caught.
.PP
Most modern shells have a builtin kill function, with a usage rather similar
to that of the command described here. The `-a' and `-p' options,
and the possibility to specify pids by command name is a local extension.
.PP
If sig is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking is still performed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.IR pid ...
Specify the list of processes that
.B kill
should signal.  Each
.I pid
can be one of five things:

.RS
.TP
.I n
where
.I n
is larger than 0.  The process with pid
.I n
will be signaled.
.TP
.B 0
All processes in the current process group are signaled.
.TP
.B -1
All processes with pid larger than 1 will be signaled.
.TP
.BI - n
where 
.I n 
is larger than 1.
All processes in process group
.I n
are signaled.  When an argument of the form `-n' is given,
and it is meant to denote a process group,
either the signal must be specified first, or the argument must be preceded
by a `--' option, otherwise it will be taken as the signal to send.
.TP
.I commandname
All processes invoked using that name will be signaled.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-s " signal"
Specify the signal to send.
The signal may be given as a signal name or number.
.TP
.B \-l
Print a list of signal names.  These are found in
.I /usr/include/linux/signal.h
.TP
.B \-a
Do not restrict the commandname-to-pid conversion to processes
with the same uid as the present process.
.TP
.B \-p
Specify that
.B kill
should only print the process id (pid)
of the named processes, and not send any signals.

Taken from BSD 4.4.  The ability to translate process names to process
ids was added by Salvatore Valente <svalente@mit.edu>.
