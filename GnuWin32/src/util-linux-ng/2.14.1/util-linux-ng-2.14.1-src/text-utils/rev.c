 * Wed Sep 14 22:26:00 1994: Patch from bjdouma <bjdouma@xs4all.nl> to handle
 *                           last line that has no newline correctly.
 * 3-Jun-1998: Patched by Nicolai Langfeldt to work better on Linux:
 * 	Handle any-length-lines.  Code copied from util-linux' setpwnam.c
 * 1999-02-22 Arkadiusz Mi¶kiewicz <misiek@pld.ORG.PL>
 * 	added Native Language Support
 * 1999-09-19 Bruno Haible <haible@clisp.cons.org>
 * 	modified to work correctly in multi-byte locales
